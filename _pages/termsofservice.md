Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the App is licensed to you on a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable basis. You may use the App only for your personal, non-commercial use, and only in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws and regulations.
Use of the App
The App uses your device's camera to scan your surroundings and create room plan models. The models are saved locally on your device, and you are solely responsible for their security and any potential loss or damage.
The App is intended for use by adults only, and you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to enter into these Terms and use the App in accordance with these Terms.
The App is provided "as is" and without any warranties, express or implied.

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the App or its associated services at any time without notice.

You may create, upload, or share content using the App, including but not limited to room plans, 3D models, comments, or other materials ("User Content"). You retain ownership of your User Content, but by creating, uploading, or sharing User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, and perpetual license to use, reproduce, distribute, display, modify, adapt, and create derivative works of your User Content for any purpose, including but not limited to promoting the App or its associated services.
You are solely responsible for your User Content and any consequences of creating, uploading, or sharing it.
